## *0. strcat*
##### The function that concatenates two strings.
* This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
* Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

## *1. strncat*
##### The function that concatenates two strings.
* The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
* it will use at most n bytes from src; and
* src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
* Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
