# 0x08. C - Recursion
## TASKS
### 0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget
* The function `void _puts_recursion(char *s)` prints a string, followed by a new line.
### 1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together
The function `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s)` prints a string in reverse.
### 2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
* The function `int _strlen_recursion(char *s)` returns the length of a string.
### 3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
* The function `int factorial(int n)` returns the factorial of a given number.
### 4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
* The function `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y)` returns the value of x raised to the power of y
* If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1
### 5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer
* The function `int _sqrt_recursion(int n)` returns the natural square root of a number.
* If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1
### 6. Inception. Is it possible?
* The function `int is_prime_number(int n)` returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
### 7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything
* The function `int is_palindrome(char *s)` returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not
* An empty string is a palindrome
### 8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...
* The function `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2)` compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
* s2 can contain the special character *.
* The special char `*` can replace any string (including an empty string)
